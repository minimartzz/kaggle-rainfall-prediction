## :star2: About the Project

Kaggle Playgorund Series S05E03 - Binary Prediction with a Rainfall Dataset. Project asks to predict the presence of rainfall on specific days given the historical data. THis is most likely a time-series data challenge.
    
I'm also using this project to test out the Polars API, along with some conventional machine learning techniques


## :bookmark_tabs: Details on Data

* `train.csv` - training dataset; `rainfall` is the binary target
* `Rainfall.csv` - Original dataset the challenge was built upon. All data used in this challenge is synthetically generated from this dataset
* `test.csv` - test dataset; predic the probability of `rainfall` for each row
* `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format
